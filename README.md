# ATM--Simulator
This is a console-based ATM simulator developed in Java. The project is designed to replicate core functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine, allowing users to perform basic banking operations such as:

💰 View Balance

🧾 View Transaction History

➕ Deposit Amount

➖ Withdraw Amount

🚪 Exit ATM

🔧 Features & Concepts Used
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The system is structured around OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to model real-world banking behaviors.

**Interfaces: Implemented for defining ATM operations, promoting abstraction and modularity.
**Encapsulation: Ensures data privacy and access control by restricting direct access to class fields.
**Inheritance: Used to derive common properties and behaviors for different ATM-related entities.
**Java Collections Framework: Utilized for storing and managing transaction records efficiently (e.g., using ArrayList or other collection classes).

🖥️ How It Works
Upon running the program, users are prompted to log in or verify their credentials (simple authentication with bank account number and ATM Pin). Once authenticated, users can choose from a menu-driven interface to perform operations. Each action is processed and reflected immediately, with transaction history recorded for review.

📌 Use Cases
**Educational project to demonstrate Java OOP concepts
**Console application development
**Beginner-friendly introduction to banking system simulations

🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)
**GUI-based version using JavaFX or Swing
**File handling or database integration for persistent storage
**User authentication system with multiple accounts
**Input validation and error handling improvements
